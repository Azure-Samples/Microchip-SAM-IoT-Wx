# Connecting the Microchip SAM-IoT WG Development Board (Part No. EV75S95A) to Azure IoT Hub

## Introduction

[Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub) is a managed service, hosted in the Cloud, that acts as a central messaging hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.

IoT Hub supports communications both from the device to the cloud and from the cloud to the device. IoT Hub supports multiple messaging patterns such as device-to-cloud telemetry, file upload from devices, and request-reply methods to control your devices from the cloud. IoT Hub monitoring helps you maintain the health of your solution by tracking events such as device creation, device failures, and device connections.

IoT Hub's capabilities help you build scalable, full-featured IoT solutions such as managing industrial equipment used in manufacturing, tracking valuable assets in healthcare, and monitoring office building usage.

## Procedure

### **Enroll Device into DPS (Device Provisioning Service)**

1. Set up certificates for the verification process:

    - Go to the certificates store sub-folder located at `\[your_path]\sam-iot-provision-main\SAM_IoT_Certs_Generator\ChainOfTrust`

    - Copy all `*.crt` files and rename each to `*.pem`

2. In the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), upload the root CA cert `root-ca.pem` in DPS and do proof-of-possession for X.509 CA certificates with your Device Provisioning Service

- Register the public part of an X.509 certificate and get a verification code

    Follow the `Register the public part of an X.509 certificate and get a verification code` section in [How to Verify Certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/how-to-verify-certificates)

    The verification code is generated by encrypting the public key portion of your X.509 certification. It will be used to validate the uploaded certificate ownership. So make sure to copy the generated verification code to clipboard for use in an upcoming step.

- Digitally sign the verification code to create a verification certificate

    Now that you've registered your root CA with Azure IoT Hub, you'll need to prove that you actually own it by:

> 1. Generating the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the
    verification code.
> 2. Generating a verification certificate using CSR above

### **Demonstrate Proof of Possession**

Upload your verification certificate to DPS for [Proof of Possession](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-3.1) with the following steps:

1. Open a Git Bash window (Start menu &gt; type `Git Bash`)

    <img src=".//media/image15.png" style="width:3.21739in;height:0.94745in" alt="A picture containing ball, clock Description automatically generated" />

2. Change the directory to your certificates store folder (which was generated by the [SAM-IoT WG Provisioning Tools Package for Windows](https://github.com/randywu763/sam-iot-provision)):

    ```bash
    cd drive\[your path]\sam-iot-provision-main\SAM_IoT_Certs_Generator\ChainOfTrust

    Example: cd /C/Users/john5/Azure/sam-iot-provision-main/SAM_IoT_Certs_Generator/ChainOfTrust
    ```

3. Generate a certification signing request (CSR) by entering the below command. A CSR is generated by encrypting these two key inputs:

    - The `root-ca.key` generated in previous step by Microchip IoT Provisioning tool. This will be used in the openssl command line below.
    - The `Verification Code` generated from DPS in previous step. You will be asked to provide this during the process of creating the CSR.

    **Note**: Once you enter to command below, you will then be asked to enter information that will be used to will be incorporated into your certificate request. Enter verification code (generated from Azure portal) when prompt for CommonName. For the rest, you can enter anything you want.

    ```bash
    openssl req -new -key root-ca.key -out azure_root_ca_verification.csr
    ```

    <img src=".//media/image16.png" style="width:6.12286in;height:3.47003in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

    As a result, the file `azure_root_ca_verification.csr` should appear in the `ChainOfTrust` sub-folder

4. Generate a verification certificate by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -req -in azure_root_ca_verification.csr -CA root-ca.crt -CAkey root-ca.key -CAcreateserial -out azure_signer_verification.cer -days 365 -sha256
    ```

    As a result, the file `azure_signer_verification.cer` should appear in the `ChainOfTrust` sub-folder

    <img src=".//media/image17.png" style="width:5.14375in;height:0.784in" alt="A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically generated" />

### **Upload the Signed Verification Certificate to DPS**

Follow the `Upload the signed verification certificate` section in
[How to Verify Certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/how-to-verify-certificates).  As a result, the status of your uploaded certification should be “Verified” as shown below (make sure to refresh the page to see the updated change in status)

<img src=".//media/image18.png" style="width:5.256in;height:1.40665in" alt="A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically generated" />

### **Add a New Enrollment Group using the Signer Certificate**

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your DPS &gt; `Manage enrollments` &gt;
Select `Enrollment Groups` tab:

    <img src=".//media/image19.png" style="width:4.86246in;height:3.09722in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

2. Add enrollment group &gt; Enter `Group name` &gt; Choose Certificate
as `Attestation Type` &gt; Choose `False` for IoT Edge Device &gt;
Choose `Intermediate Certificate` as Certificate Type &gt; Upload
`\[path]\.microchip-iot\signer-ca.pem` to Primary Certificate &gt;
select `Evenly weighted distribution` for how you want to assign
devices to hub &gt; select your IoT Hub that this new enrollment group
can assign to &gt; leave the rest as their existing defaults &gt; hit
`Save`

     <img src=".//media/image20.png" style="width:3in;height:5in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

   Once this has been done, your enrollment group name should show up in the `Enrollment Groups` tab

### **Program the Plug and Play Demo**

1. Clone/download the MPLAB X demo project
    by issuing the following commands in a `Command Prompt` or `PowerShell`
    window:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Microchip-SAM-IoT-Wx.git
    cd Microchip-SAM-IoT-Wx
    git submodule update --init
    ```

2. Launch the MPLAB X IDE and navigate to the main toolbar's `File` > `Open Project` operation to load the demo project folder (\*.X) located
    at:

    ```bash
    [your_path]\Microchip-SAM-IoT-Wx\firmware\AzureIotPnpDps.X
    ```

   If the `load error` message in red appears, click on the `Resolve DFP for configuration: default` link: 

    <img src=".//media/image21.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.00833in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

3. Set the `AzureIotPnpDps` project as the main (currently focused/active) project by right-clicking on it and selecting `Set as Main Project`

    <img src=".//media/image41.png" style="width:5.in;height:3.18982in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

4. Verify the project properties are set correctly before building the
   project

    - Connect the board to PC, then make sure `CURIOSITY` device shows up as a disk drive in a `File Explorer` window

    - Right-click the project `AzureIotPnPDps` &gt; select `Properties` &gt; select "SAMD21-IoT WG-SN" for `Connected Hardware Tool` &gt; select the latest `SAMD21_DFP` version &gt; select the latest XC32 version for `Compiler Toolchain`. If any changes were made in the project properties window, the `Apply` button should become enabled.  Make sure to hit the `Apply` button before hitting `OK`

5. Build the project and set up a Command Line Interface (CLI) to the board:

    - Open a serial terminal (e.g. PuTTY, TeraTerm, etc.) and connect to the COM port corresponding to your board at 9600 baud (e.g. open PuTTY Configuration window &gt; choose `session` &gt; choose `Serial` &gt; Enter the right `COMx` port). You can find the COM info by opening your PC’s Device Manager &gt; expand `Ports(COM & LPT)` &gt; take note of `Curiosity Virtual COM Port`. 

        <img src=".//media/image27.png" style="width:3in;height:3in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

    - Right-click the `AzureIotPnPDps` project and select `Make and Program Device`.  This operation will automatically clean and build the project before attempting to program the target device. After the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message appears in the Output window, the application HEX file will be programmed onto the SAM-IoT board. Once programming has finished, the board will automatically reset and start running its application code.

6. Launch a terminal emulator window and connect to the COM port corresponding to the SAM-IoT board at `9600` baud (**disable** local echo for the terminal settings for best results). Hit `[RETURN]` to bring up the Command Line Interface prompt (which is simply the `>` character). Type `help` and then hit `[RETURN]` to get the list of available commands for the Command Line Interface (CLI).  The Command Line Interface allows you to send simple ASCII-string commands to set or get the user-configurable operating parameters of the application while it is running.  The CLI prompt is simply the `>` character

    <img src=".//media/image44.png" style="width:5.in;height:3.18982in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

7. In the terminal emulator window, set the debug messaging level to 0 to temporarily disable the output messages. Use the `debug <level>` command by manually typing it into the Command Line Interface (CLI).  The complete command must be followed by hitting `[RETURN]`
    ```bash
    >debug 0
    ```

8. Configure the SAM-IoT board's internal Wi-Fi settings with your wireless router’s SSID and password using the `wifi` command by manually typing it into the Command Line Interface (CLI).  The complete command must be followed by hitting `[RETURN]` (there cannot be any spaces used in the SSID or password)
    ```bash
    >wifi <NETWORK_SSID>,<PASSWORD>,<SECURITY_OPTION[1=Open|2=WPA|3=WEP]>
    ```
    For example, if the SSID of the router is "MyWirelessRouter" and the WPA key is "MyRoutersPassword", the exact command to type into the CLI (followed by `[RETURN]`) would be:
    ```bash
    >wifi MyWirelessRouter,MyRoutersPassword,2
    ```

9. Look up the ID Scope corresponding to your DPS in the Microsoft Azure Portal.  This value is displayed in a web browser when clicking on `Overview` on the DPS resource page (the DPS should have been created earlier using a web page interface on the Azure Portal).  The ID Scope is programmed/saved into the SAM-IoT board in the next step using a CLI command (allowing you to change the ID Scope for the board without having to reprogram the MCU's application firmware)

    <img src=".//media/image23.png" style="width:6.5.in;height:1.43506in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

10. In the terminal emulator window, confirm that `local echo` is **disabled** in the terminal settings. Hit `[RETURN]` to bring up the Command Line Interface prompt (which is simply the `>` character). At the CLI prompt, type in the command `idscope <MY_ID_SCOPE>` to set the ID Scope (which gets saved in the ATECC608A secure element on the SAM-IoT board) and then hit `[RETURN]`. To confirm it was set correctly, the ID Scope can be read out from the board by issuing the `idscope` command (i.e. without specifying an ID Scope value as the parameter on the command line)

    <img src=".//media/image46.png" style="width:5.in;height:3.18982in" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" />

11. At the CLI prompt, type in the command `reset` and hit `[RETURN]` to restart the host application using the updated ID Scope to establish a connection to your DPS
    ```bash
    >reset
    ```
    
12.	Wait for the SAM-IoT board to connect to your DPS and stabilize (it could take a few minutes); eventually the Blue and Green LEDs should both stay constantly on (which signifies a successful & stable connection to DPS).  If the Red LED comes on and stays lit, then something was incorrectly programmed (e.g. application firmware, Wi-Fi credentials, ID Scope).  If the Blue LED is not constantly on, then there is an issue with connecting to your wireless access point.

13. To enable the “full” debug messaging output to the terminal emulator window, execute the command `debug 4` on the Command Line Interface (CLI).  To completely disable the debug messages at any time, execute the command `debug 0` (debug levels range from 0 to 4).  The CLI is always active, even while debug messages are being continuously displayed on the terminal window.

### **Verify the SAM-IoT Device Registration to Azure IoT Hub**

A successful SAM-IoT to Azure DPS connection can be verified two ways:

1) Correct device ID shows up in the DPS enrollment
2) Correct device ID shows up in the IoT Hub

Procedure:

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), go to your DPS &gt; click `Manage enrollments` &gt; under Enrollment Group, click `your group name` &gt; click `Registration Records` &gt; device should show up with the IoT Hub info that it got assigned to
