    spi2.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the SPI2 driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for SPI2.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.169.0
        Device            :  PIC24FJ128GA705
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.50
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.40
